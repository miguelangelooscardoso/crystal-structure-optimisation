# crystal-structure-optimisation

Shell scripting is used to create input (potentials, SCF and JXC) files with both, the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package and the Munich SPRKKR-program package for structures such as cubic <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Fe_2MnSi  " /> L$_12$ Fe$_2$MnSi to DO$_19$ Fe$_2$MnGe. A script was created yet to gather all the exchange-correlation energies from a SPR-KKR output.
